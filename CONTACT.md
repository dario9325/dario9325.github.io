## This is me

My name is Dario, I'm a *technology enthusiast* and a *passionate gamer*.

I play with my *Debian distribution* since 2000, where possible I like to 
unleash all my potential at work with Linux, Ubuntu right now.

I'm a *Java developer* and I like to know and try all the libraries and projects
around this programming language. My favourite IDE is 
[Apache NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/) (try it!). I started in 2005 a 
local Java User Group in Padova, Italy: ([JugPadova](http://www.jugpadova.it)).

I use Windows only for games! I like *Grand Theft Auto*, *Red Dead Redemption
II*, *Dead By Daylight* and *Call Of Duty: Warzone*.
